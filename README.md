u/RemindMeBTC is a reddit bot by /u/dmesticg based on the famous bot /u/RemindMeBot

where instead of getting reminded in 2 weeks/days/years, you get messaged when bitcoin hits a certain price.

How to Use: Comment "RemindMeBTC! price" (example: RemindMeBTC! 25000)

A HUGE thanks to the people of the “Programming Discussions” Discord Server for helping me out with some of the issues I was having with my code. (ESPECIALLY @devoidfury)



I made this bot in 2017 and have not worked on it since. If you would like to continue with the bot please submit a pull request :D

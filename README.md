RemindMeBTC is a bot based on the famous /u/RemindMeBot, where instead of getting reminded in 2 weeks/days/years, you get reminded when bitcoin reaches a certain price.

How to Use: Comment "RemindMeBTC! price" (example: RemindMeBTC! 25000)

A HUGE thanks to the people of the “Programming Discussions” Discord Server for helping me out with some of the issues I was having with my code. (ESPECIALLY @devoidfury)
